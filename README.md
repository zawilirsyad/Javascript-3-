# JavaScript Asynchronous Programming and Promises

## Overview

This project includes various exercises related to JavaScript asynchronous programming. The tasks focus on the use of `Promise`, `then-catch`, `try-catch`, callback functions, and `fetch` for interacting with APIs. Below are the details for each task.

---

## Task 1: Handling Asynchronous Code with Promises

You are required to create two variations of a program to check for working days using both:
1. **`then-catch`** pattern
2. **`try-catch`** with `async/await`

### Asynchronous Function

```javascript
const cekHariKerja = (day) => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            const dataDay = ['senin', 'selasa', 'rabu', 'kamis', 'jumat'];
            let cek = dataDay.find((item) => item === day);
            if (cek) {
                resolve(cek);
            } else {
                reject(new Error('Hari ini bukan hari kerja'));
            }
        }, 3000);
    });
};
```
### Explanation:
then-catch
- then: This method is called when the promise is resolved successfully (i.e., the day is a working day). It will log the result to the console.
- catch: This method is called when the promise is rejected (i.e., the day is not a working day). It will log the error message to the console.

try-catch
- try: The code inside the try block attempts to resolve the promise using await. If successful, it logs the result.
- catch: If the promise is rejected, the catch block handles the error and logs the error message.

## Task 2: Callback Function to Display All Months
Create a program using a callback function that displays all months using the map method.

### Explanation:
-getMonth: This function simulates an asynchronous operation to fetch month data. If successful, it passes the data to the callback function. If thereâ€™s an error, it calls the callback with an error object.
-showMonth: This callback function displays all months using the map() method if no error occurred. Otherwise, it logs the error message.

## Task 3: Create Two Programs Using Promises

- Check student name data
- Check the Nasi Padang menu data

## Task 4: Fetch Data from REST API
Using the fetch method, retrieve and display all user names from the following API:
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

### Explanation:
fetch: This method is used to retrieve data from the API. It returns a promise that resolves into a response.
response.json(): This method parses the response data into JSON format.
data.map(): The .map() method is used to extract the name property from each user object in the API response.
Debugger: You can use the Chrome browser's built-in debugger to view the network requests and logs in the console by pressing F12.

## How to Run the Program
-Clone or download the repository.
-Open each task file in a text editor.
-To run the code, use a browser's console or a Node.js environment.
